# Epic 1 Retrospective: Foundation — Dev Agent Pilot

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Facilitator:** Bob (Scrum Master)
**Epic Status:** Complete (5/5 stories done)

---

## Epic Summary

**Epic 1: Foundation — Dev Agent Pilot** validated the customize file approach by populating bmm-dev.customize.yaml with Ignition domain knowledge. The Developer agent can now generate valid Perspective views, UDT definitions, Jython 2.7 scripts, and ISA-18.2 alarm configurations.

### Delivery Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Stories Completed | 5/5 (100%) |
| Total Memories Added | 45 |
| Total Critical Actions Added | 12 |
| Code Review Fixes | 4 stories required fixes |
| Blocking Issues | 0 |

### Stories Completed

| Story | Description | Key Output |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 1.1 | Platform Constraints | 15 memories (Jython 2.7, Perspective JSON, UDT patterns, tag paths) |
| 1.2 | ISA Standards | 15 memories (ISA-101, ISA-18.2, ISA-95, ISA-88) |
| 1.3 | Critical Actions | 9 critical actions (validation, syntax, safety) |
| 1.4 | Tooling Integration | 12 memories + 3 critical actions (ignition-lint, ignition.nvim, workflow) |
| 1.5 | Validate Behavior | Gate validation passed + 3 remediation memories |

## Successes and Strengths

### 1. Customize File Approach Validated
The core hypothesis of Epic 1 — that memories + critical_actions can meaningfully change agent behavior — was proven true. The Dev agent now references ISA standards, generates valid Jython 2.7 syntax, and follows Ignition-specific patterns.

### 2. Real-World Gateway Validation
Agent-generated output was tested in an actual Ignition Gateway:
- UDT imported into Designer successfully
- Instance created with OPC path mapping
- Jython script executed without errors

This real-world validation is the gold standard for acceptance.

### 3. Memory Format Pattern Established
The rule + context format (1-3 sentences, backticks for code) worked consistently across all 5 stories. This pattern is now proven and ready for reuse in Epic 2.

### 4. Code Review Process Effective
4 out of 5 stories had code review fixes documented. This demonstrates a healthy review process catching issues before they ship:
- Story 1.1: Print statement fix, UDT inheritance clarification
- Story 1.2: Architecture Compliance Checklist, ISA-95 memory differentiation
- Story 1.4: Memory count corrections, terminology alignment
- Story 1.5: AC3/AC4 remediations

### 5. Architecture Compliance Checklist
The checklist from the Architecture document ensured consistent quality:
- All memories follow rule + context format
- Code references use backticks
- ISA standards use ID-only format (no years)
- Ignition terms use official capitalization
- Critical actions start with imperative verbs

### 6. Thorough Story Documentation
Every story included:
- Clear Dev Notes with context
- Architecture Compliance Checklist
- Completion Notes with specific evidence
- References to source documents
- Change Log tracking all modifications

## Challenges and Growth Areas

### 1. Critical Actions Required Memory Reinforcement
**Issue:** Critical actions were compiled as "activation steps" in the agent but weren't being proactively applied during chat responses.

**Evidence:** Story 1.5 initially failed AC3 (tag path warnings) and AC4 (tooling mentions) despite critical actions existing for both.

**Resolution:** Added 3 remediation memories to reinforce critical action behaviors. After recompilation, the agent proactively warned about tag paths and mentioned validation workflow.

**Learning:** Add reinforcement memories alongside critical actions going forward.

### 2. Code Review Fixes Across Multiple Stories
**Issue:** 4 out of 5 stories required code review fixes.

**Assessment:** This is actually healthy — the review process is working. However, some issues could have been caught earlier:
- Incorrect technical explanations (print statement syntax)
- Missing checklist items (Architecture Compliance not checked off)
- Documentation inconsistencies (memory counts)

**Learning:** Self-review against the compliance checklist before requesting code review.

---

## Key Insights and Learnings

### 1. Memories vs Critical Actions
- **Memories:** Always in agent context, reliably applied
- **Critical Actions:** Compiled as activation steps, may need memory reinforcement for proactive application
- **Pattern:** Add companion memories for critical actions that need proactive surfacing

### 2. Validation Strategy
- Real Ignition Gateway testing is the ultimate acceptance criterion
- Lint and LSP checks are necessary but not sufficient
- Agent output that imports and runs is the true measure of success

### 3. Documentation Patterns
- Memory count tracking (0 → 15 → 30 → 42 → 45) provides clear progression
- References section connecting to PRD/Architecture maintains traceability
- Change Log captures evolution and fixes

### 4. ISA Standards Integration
- ID-only format (ISA-18.2, not ISA-18.2:2016) keeps content evergreen
- Actionable patterns in memories work better than general references
- Real examples (priority levels, alarm states) improve agent output

## Action Items

### Process Improvements

| Action | Owner | Deadline | Success Criteria |
|--------|-------|----------|------------------|
| Add reinforcement memories alongside critical actions | Dev Agent | During Epic 2 | Each critical action has companion memory |
| Document memory format pattern for reuse | Charlie | Before Story 2.1 | Single-page reference with format, examples, checklist |

### Team Agreements

1. Continue using Architecture Compliance Checklist for all customize file changes
2. Validate agent output in real Ignition Gateway when possible
3. Track memory counts in story documentation
4. Self-review against compliance checklist before requesting code review

## Epic 2 Preparation

### Parallel Development Strategy

**Recommended Approach:** Stories 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 can run in parallel (different customize files, no conflicts). Story 2.4 runs sequentially after all three complete.

| Phase | Stories | Approach |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Phase 1 | 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 | Parallel (swarm) |
| Phase 2 | 2.4 | Sequential (validation) |

**Efficiency Gain:** ~40% faster than fully sequential

### Preparation Tasks

| Task | Owner | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Verify customize files exist (Analyst, PM, Architect) | Charlie | Pending |
| Review ISA-95/ISA-88 content from Architecture doc | Elena | Pending |

### Dependencies on Epic 1

- Memory format pattern (rule + context, 1-3 sentences, backticks)
- Critical action format (imperative verbs, 1-2 sentences)
- Architecture compliance checklist
- YAML validation workflow
- Reinforcement memory pattern (new from Epic 1 learnings)
